# BabylonJS Tutorial Seriesâ€“Getting Started

> Babylon.js is a JavaScript API for building and rendering 3D games within a browser, using HTML5, WebGL, WebVR and Web Audio. In this Babylon.js Tutorial, we provide an introduction to Babylon.js and the Javascript API it is based on, WebGL. We then showcase a code demo where we walk through the steps of creating a 3D object, setting the scene's lights, cameras, meshes, and materials.
